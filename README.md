# Movie List code task App

This is a code task I built that shows you the most popular movies and allows you to get some info about them using the [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) API

## Demo

Demo of the app available [here](https://adria-movies-code-task.netlify.app/)

## Installation

Do not forget to install all dependencies on each directory that provides a `package.json` file, and then run:

```sh
$ npm install
```
### `Project Initialization`

It has no server side and only consumes an API so simply run:

```sh
$ npm run start
```
